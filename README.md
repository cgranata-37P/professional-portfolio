# My Professional-Portfolio  

## Description
 To create a portfolio that showcases my skills and talents to future employers and colleagues.

### Criteria
* When future employers and colleagues visit my website they can see my name, a photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* WHEN my navigation links are clicked
the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN my Work link is clicked in the navbar
the UI scrolls to my Work section with titled images of my applications
* WHEN in the Work section my first application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN my image applications are clicked the users are taken to that deployed application
* WHEN my website's pages or views are resized is resized on various screens and devises my users are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### What I learned
* This was a very challenging task to meet the criteria, but was a great exercise in HTML and CSS for a begginer. I am confident, with repetitive practice I will get my porfolio to where I want it to be.
